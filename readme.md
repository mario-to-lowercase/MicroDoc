## üåç Server Configuration

To enable direct access to pages using custom URLs, include the following configuration based on your web server:

#### Apache (.htaccess)

If you are using Apache, create or update your `.htaccess` file with the following rules:
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.html?url=$1 [QSA,L]
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
```

#### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, add the following configuration to your server block:

```
location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html?url=$uri;
}
```

This ensures that custom URLs are properly routed to the index.html file, allowing your Microblog pages to be accessible via their defined URLs.
